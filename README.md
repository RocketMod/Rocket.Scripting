# Rocket.Scripting

This repository contains the builtin scripting providers for the RocketMod game server plugin framework.

The providers act as plugins and add support for various scripting languages, like JavaScript or C# (via cs-script).


To start a scripting session use /e start <language>, after that you eval REPL expressions via /e <expression>. To exit, write /eval exit.
